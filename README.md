# Loan-Prediction
This dataset is a from a competition on the data science website AnalyticsVidhya. The goal of this dataset is to create a machine learning classification model that predicts whether a loan applicant shall be accepted or declined a loan, given application information.

My overall workflow was as follows:

1. Loading the data and EDA
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Model Selection
4. Data transformation & Feature Selection
5. Hyperparameter Optimization
6. Prediction Threshold Optimization
7. Model Interpretability & Uncertainty

The highlight of this project is the latter parts, in which I treated the problem as a business case rather than a data science competition. I investigated how the business can optimize profits under different pricing assumptions. I also computed metrics that will get organizational buy-ins to get the model in production.
